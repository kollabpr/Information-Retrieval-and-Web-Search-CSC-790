detailed discussion of the periodic solutions of the differential

theory of triode oscillations has been built up for this case  in
practice however  the graph of has a much flatter bottom than that
of the function and cartwright of and of has raised the question
whether this flattening will alter the performance of the circuit
near resonance  the main part of this paper is an attempt to answer
this question  an estimate is made of the permissible degree of flattening
of the curve without the detuning diagram losing any of its significant
properties  various pertinent theorems are established and the
possible periodic solutions of the equation are discussed in relation
to the detuning diagram  particular results include the following
a if k is small enough and the value of lies in a certain small range
near forced oscillations with half the applied frequency are possible
two of these have amplitudes very large compared with that of the
applied emf one mode being stable and the other unstable only when

a consideration of the electron disappearance in the layer of the
ionosphere  factors influencing the electron concentration and conventional
theories of recombination and attachment are reviewed  nocturnal
diffusion can account for only a small variation of concentration
but its effect on the altitude of maximum concentration is not necessarily
negligible  statistical analysis indicates that the influence
of pressure on the nocturnal variation of electron concentration
is unexpectedly small while that of temperature is large analysis
of the monthly mean values indicates that attachment rather than
recombination is the mechanism responsible for the electron disappearance
the influence of layer movements though not large is significant
further evidence in favour of the attachment theory is obtained from consideration
of distribution and from a comparison of the nocturnal
concentration variations at two sites  theoretical considerations
favour a process of electron removal in which collisions between
atomic ions of oxygen and excited molecules of nitrogen produce molecular
ions of nitrogen which in turn recombine with electrons

tht the ionizing radiation from the solar disk is not uniformly distributed

nonuniform component of the ionizing radiation appears to be divided
about equally between the east and west limbs of the sun  this is
consistent with observations made at meudon of the distribution over

discrepancy between the values of the parameter proportional to the

seriously affected and the amplifier may be unstable if used as an
integrator or differentiator  the method is extended to cover the
case of a dc amplifier with a low pass feedback network the gain
of such an amplifier can be varied over a wide range without appreciable

the association of solar radio bursts of spectral type with chromospheric
flares  simultaneous optical and radio observations were made
for over flares of which were of class and of which are associated
with type events  of the bursts were recorded during the life of
the flare usually near the beginning  the probability of a burst
accompanying a flare is greater for large flares and is the same
for flares on the east limb as for those in the centre of the disk
this implies a wide cone of escape for type radiation

methods and results under the following main headings reflected radio
waves observed at closely spaced points observations of movements
of large scale irregularities in the f region observations of waves
from radio stairs observations of waves reflected from meteor trails
observations of waves reflected from the sporadic e layer  the following
conclusions are reached at all levels in the ionosphere systematic
as well as irregular horizontal movements are present  typical velocities
are of the order of there is a tendency for the velocity to increase
with height  the systematic movements have the form of regular diurnal
and seasonal variations and show considerable consistency between
observations made in the northern and southern hemispheres  at heights
around km the semi diurnal components of the velocity as determined
by fourier analysis are found to represent a uniformly rotating velocity
vector the direction of the rotation is clockwise in the northern
hemisphere and anti clockwise in the southern hemisphere  this is
the type of movement predicted by the theory of atmospheric oscillations
though the phase of the rotation is not that expected theoretically
at times of magnetic disturbance the velocities of the horizontal
movements are increased and this phenomenon becomes more marked with
increasing height in the atmosphere  at velocities as high as have
been recorded during magnetic storms  a brief summary of observations
by non radio methods is included  about references

ionization distribution in the f region  the height distribution
of ionization in the composite f region is calculated on the assumptions
that the scale height ie the temperature increases and the recombination
coefficient decreases with height in this region  the recombination
coefficient is assumed to vary in terms of the reduced height that
is the height above f max measured in terms of the actual height
as had been done earlier by ap mitra in making similar calculations
the present assumption automatically takes into account the effect
of rising temperature on the value of the recombination coefficient
height distribution curves for high and low latitude stations are
drawn for typical summer and winter conditions in the high atmosphere
in the f region  when the possible effect of ionospheric tidal drifts
are taken into account the forms of the distribution curves and the
separation between the f and f layers agree with those deduced from
observations  the results support the view that the f and f layers
belong to a common bank of ionization produced by solar radiation

cathode and thus the net space charge density is constant as in a

emission from the cathodes  the discrepancy between earlier experimental
results showing that ions of energy of the order of cathode fall
of potential arrive at the cathode and classical calculations leading

and waves simultaneously  observations made at kjeller in and at
tromsoe during early are reported  echoes are only received when
the aerial is directed towards the north the echo amplitude has a
maximum value when the aerial is directed horizontally and decreases
rapidly with increased elevation of the aerial  the results indicate
that there is no correlation between the position of visible aurorae
and echo range but that there is a correlation between the occurrence
of high e layer critical frequency and the reception of echoes  during
geomagnetic storms echoes on are observed only during the more severe
phases  scattering from the ground or sea reflected back vis an intense
e layer is advanced in explanation of the observations

study of the ionospheric d region using partial reflections  pulse
echo observations were made with a transmitter of peak power and
with the receiver located where the noise level was very low  results
showed that below the e layer there were two reflection regions a
region of greater electron density around extending up to the normal
e layer and having minimum ionization at noon a region around km
where a distinct ionized layer forms during the day attains a maximum
ionization at noon and disappears at night  in echoes from this region
both magneto ionic components were present the extraordinary being
the stronger  the ratio of the two magneto ionic components of a
discrete echo at a particular range was within the uncertainty of
observation independent of fading but varied with time of day and
from day to day  from this ratio the collision frequency and electron
density for this range of heights were determined

that a region with arbitrary height distribution of ionization will

for levels is a few hours if the radio determinations of density

the structure of the f region of the ionosphere  the effects of temperature
cycles of a decay coefficient which is nonuniform with height
and of vertical tidal drifts are considered  the diurnal and seasonal
height variations of the f region are explained qualitatively by
postulating in addition to the vertical tides acting on an isothermal
chapman region a diurnal temperature cycle  this requires a decay
coefficient which does not change rapidly with height  on an alternative
hypothesis involving discontinuities in the height gradient of the
decay coefficient tidal drifts are still necessary but a diurnal
temperature cycle is not of major importance

solution of the motition of an infinite neutral ionized plane

magnetic field whose intensity decreases as an inverse power of the
distance from an axis to which the sheet is parallel  the gas in

recedes again  the gas far to either side moves onward with little
distortion  between these central and outer parts there are two strips
of the sheet whose ions and electrons separate from each other under
the influence of the magnetic field partly because these strips become
much extended and reduced to low density  some charges are deviated
away to infinity others are captured by the field and build up a

respect to the signal hf the amplitude of the current varies continually
with time  the variations are due partly to energy dissipation during
the intervals between the signals and partly to beating of the forced
oscillations due to the signals with the natural oscillations of
the circuit  the latter effect is particularly noticeable in a very
selective circuit but its magnitude is largely dependent on the degree
of mistuning of the circuit  see also of

the effect of noise on the frequency stability of a linear oscillator
the standard conditions for a sinusoidal oscillation are that the
attenuation and net phase shift around the closed loop be zero  random
fluctuations are relied upon to start the oscillation  if the level
of oscillation is to remain finite in the continued presence of noise
the oscillating loop must hav  some attenuation and functions like
a highly regenerative amplifier with a loop gain very nearly unity
accordingly the oscillator produces not a single frequency but rather
a narrow band of noise that causes instability in the magnitude and
in the apparent frequency of the output  thes instabilities are discussed
for oscillators in which all elements are linear except for some
slow acting amplitude control  the bandwidth of the noisy oscillation
can be predicted from easily measured system characteristics  several
methods of defining the frequency of the output are considered with
special reference to precision measurements  in general the measured
frequency departs from the zero phase shift criterion and is dependent
on the measuring equipment  methods of minimizing instabilities due

the variation of decimetre wave radiation with solar activity  a
statistical method is used to segregate the quiet component from
the slowly varing component of solar decimetre wave radiation in
the period  for this purpose the radiations at frequencies and have
been correlated with sunspot numbers sunspot areas and faculae  the
mean lives of the various radiations and activities have been estimated
and compared  there is an increase of life with decreasing radio
frequency  the life of radiation is about the same as sunspots but
measurements of the latter show some anomalies  the slowly varying
radiation flux is proportional to frequency in the range studied
the quiet sun flux has a small but significant variation with solar
activity the relative change being greater for smaller frequencies
the possibility that this variation may be associated with uncorrelated
local sources such as prominences is not entirely excluded

the transient response of rf and if filters to a wave packet  summary
only  analysis based on fourier integral transforms is applied to
two particular circuits a single stage of tuned anode coupling a
single stage of tuned transformer coupling  the analysis is valid
for circuits of any bandwidth  particular attention is paid to the
build up time of a transient which for a band pass network is usually
assumed to be inversely proportional to the network bandwidth  the
analysis shows that this assumption is correct for the tuned anode
coupling circuit if the ratio of the half bandwidth to the resonance
frequency is less than unity  for the tuned transformer circuit however
the rule does not hold good since for a given bandwidth there are
many possible transfer impedances and hence transient responses
the rule should therefore only be applied to circuits which its application
is shown to be legitimate

in different types of oscillator  the nature of the random fluctuation
in the output is dependent on the form of feedback employed and
the method by which the output amplitude is controlled  the frequency
band over which the output power is distributed depends however on
the relative magnitudes of signal and noise in the circuit rather
than on the particular circuit employed  the conclusion is that an
oscillator should be operated at as high a level as possible consistent
with stability and constancy of the circuit components

the origin of the ionospheric irregularities responsible for radio

attributes the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities in the f

of km  the resulting turbulent component of the electric potential
field produced is communicated to the f region as suggested by martyn
where magneto electric forces then cause the ionization to form eddies
it is suggested that the absence of daytime scintillations is due
to the inhibition of turbulent flow by large temperature gradients

of radio star scintillations together with the long term correlation
of scintillation amplitude with magnetic activity and the variation

behaviour of the ionosphere at rome during the partial solar eclipse
of june  observed eclipse effects are compared with effects calculated
on the assumption that the electrons are produced by photo ionization
and removed by ionic recombination or attachment ot neutral atoms
and molecules and that the ionizing radiation is distributed uniformly
over the visible disk of the sun  it is deduced that the electron
loss rate is consistent with an ionic recombination process in the layer
the attachment and recombination coefficients decrease with increasing
height their variations during the eclipse are related to the vertical
movements of the ionosphere  seasonal variations between effects
observed in a number of eclipses are explained in terms of different
degrees of superposition of the and layers  the existence of secondary
minima of electron density is interpreted as indicating that a distinction

an analysis of bursts of solar radio emission and their association
with solar and terrestrial phenomena  solar radio emission records
on seven frequencies in the range were studied over a period of months
the analysis which includes a number of histograms shows that many
of the properties of bursts change with frequency  a study of the
time delay between bursts on different frequencies revealed that
bursts often occur first a simultaneous up and down movement of ionized
material from the level of zero refractive index at that frequency
is postulated  it is found that bursts were more frequent than flares
fadeouts and crochets and that they almost always accompanied these
effects  the commencement of bursts appears to be simultaneous with
that of flares and crochets but precedes that of fadeouts by about
two minutes  in addition there is a rough correlation between the
intensity of bursts flares fadeouts and crochets
